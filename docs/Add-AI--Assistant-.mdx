### **Seamless Deployment: Setting Up Your AI-Assistant Easily**

Your AI-Assistant designed by Mext, powered by ChatGPT, is ready for immediate deployment—no additional integration required. Follow these simple steps to customize and bring your AI-Assistant to life.

Start by clicking on “Add a new assistant”

.

A.	Name Your Assistant :

Choose a catchy name for your AI-Assistant. This name will be displayed above your AI-Assistant's head.

	Refer to Section 1.1.2 for guidelines on selecting an effective name.

B.	Add Instructions :

Crafting clear and effective instructions is crucial for shaping your AI's behavior and ensuring a positive user experience.

	Section 3.3.3 provides detailed guidance on writing instructions for optimal performance and continuous improvement.

C.	Enable Responsive Savings

D.	Choose an Avatar Model:

Click on the "Choose an Avatar model" button to select or customize an avatar model for your AI-Assistant.

You can personalize the avatar to match your brand guidelines or the theme of your event! Whether you want a playful appearance or clothing that represents your brand, the choice is yours!

E.	Add the AI-Assistant to Your 3D Space (Metaverse):

•	After creating your virtual AI-Assistant, visit "Manage Spaces  Create/Edit your 3D space" to add the avatar to you’re your space .

•	Place the AI-Assistant anywhere in your Metaverse space, treating it like any other 3D asset.

•	Once added to your space, you can easily move your avatar to any spot you like within your 3D space.

•	As soon as you add your assistant to your 3D space, you can see it right away and begin testing it from the visitor's perspective.

F.	Add Knowledge

To customize your AI-Assistant to your business, brand, topic, or event, you can upload files in .docx, .pdf, or .xls formats by clicking on the "file" icon. This will integrate all your knowledge into your AI-Assistant, prioritizing it when responding to visitors and carrying out assigned tasks.

We suggest compiling all the information you want your AI assistant to know into a single Word file. This is faster and more efficient than using multiple files.

G.	Testing

It's crucial to thoroughly test your AI-Assistant before launching it.

First step, start by testing it through the Admin Backoffice by clicking the triangle icon:

Ask questions to the avatar and analyze the responses to identify any limitations. Then, update either the instructions or the knowledge accordingly.

For example as you can see above, the AI-Assistant doesn't recognize its affiliation with Mext “check their lastest releases”, therefore we need to update the instructions to clarify its role within the Mext team.

After adding new instruction “You are part of Mext support team”, observe how the AI-Assistant's responses change.

Next, let’s incorporate event information by uploading a Word file containing the relevant details about Mext next events

Then let’s test the AI-Assistant again with the same questions to see how it responds to the new information:

Note any improvements, such as the AI-Assistant correctly indicating the information from the document.

Continue refining the instructions and knowledge until the AI-Assistant can accurately respond to all queries. Following these steps will help you refine the "instruction" and "knowledge" to create the perfect AI-Assistant for your business.

In a second step, you'll want to test Spatial Audio with the AI-Assistant in Avatar mode\:you need to test Spatial Audio with AI-Assistant in Avatar mode:

Click on the chat icon to begin a conversation with the avatar.

Ensure that the answers provided are of good quality. If the responses are too lengthy, consider adjusting the word limit in the instruction section.

With these straightforward steps, you'll have a fully customized, interactive, and branded AI-Assistant, effortlessly enhancing your 3D space within Mext.
