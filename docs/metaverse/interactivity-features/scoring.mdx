In the Metaverse, a scoring system is a pivotal tool for assessing a participant's performance and stimulating participant engagement. It assigns numerical values or points to various actions and accomplishments within the Metaverse, enabling you to create challenges, provide rewards, and allowing participants to monitor their progress, compete with others, and set personal improvement goals. These scoring systems can take various forms and serve several essential functions.

In the Mext Metaverse platform, the key principle is the flexibility to assign specific point values to diverse actions that contribute to a participant's overall score. There is an extensive list of categorized actions, each with its associated point values, that can be customized to align with your objectives for scoring. For example, if you're hosting an Exhibition Metaverse and aim to incentivize your community to attend conferences, you can assign high scores to actions related to conferences such as attending a conference session, active participation in chat discussions, and more.

This adaptable scoring approach empowers you to tailor the Metaverse experience to your specific goals, encouraging meaningful engagement and competition among participants, while offering a dynamic way to measure and reward their contributions within the virtual realm.

## Scoring System Configuration

To configure the scoring system, all you need to do is assign specific point values to actions that align with your objectives. The system will then promptly calculate the weight percentage for each group of actions to ensure that it aligns with your intended objectives accurately.

Remember to save any modifications to your scoring system whenever you make changes. You also have the option to disable the scoring system at any time by simply clicking on the "Disable Scoring" button.

## Leaderboard

The leaderboard showcases the ranking and scores of your participants.

Clicking the 'eye' icon allows you to view the specific actions taken by each participant.
