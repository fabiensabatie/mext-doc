# Partnership calls

Partnership calls within the Mext Metaverse are a specialized feature designed to foster collaboration and networking among users within the virtual environment. These calls are an opportunity for partners to extend their reach, connect with potential collaborators, and explore new business relationships.

## Initiating Partnership Calls
