# AI-Assistants in the Mext Metaverse

The Mext Metaverse integrates OpenAI's assistants API to create AI assistants that bring a new level of interactivity and support to the virtual experience. These assistants are crafted to reflect the same functionality as standard assistants but are enhanced with avatar association capabilities via ready player me and are specifically bound to their Mext Metaverse context. This ensures that clients receive personalized assistance without the possibility of accessing free OpenAI assistants external to our platform.

## Creating Your AI Assistant

To get started, head to the **Ai assistant** feature of the **Interactivity features** section on [your dashboard](https://dashboard.mext.app/metaverse). Then click on **Add new assistant**. You will then be prompted for :

- A **name**: Begin by giving a name to your AI-Assistant that resonates with its intended purpose and the ambiance of the Metaverse.
- **Instructions**: Add instructional content that will guide the AI-Assistant's interactions with users. These instructions shape the behavior and response patterns of the assistant to cater to user needs effectively.
- **Choose an avatar**: With [ReadyPlayerMe](https://readyplayer.me/), select or create an avatar that embodies the personality and style of your AI-Assistant, enriching the visual appeal and making interactions more engaging for users.

### Files

Once you've created your assistant, click on <img src={"/img/metaverse/add-document.png"} width="20" /> to upload any relevant files that the AI-Assistant may need to reference or utilize during its operation within the Metaverse. **Each assistant is limited to 10 files, 10MB each**.

### Contextual Binding

Your AI-Assistant is intrinsically linked to the specific context of your Mext Metaverse, ensuring that it operates within the defined environment and serves the unique needs of your participants and activities.
