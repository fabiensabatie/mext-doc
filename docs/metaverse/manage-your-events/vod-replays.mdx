This is the section where you can add Video On Demand (VOD) to make informative videos and replays of your past events available as Video On Demand (VOD) for your Metaverse visitors. By adding replays and VOD content, you provide an opportunity for visitors to access and watch previously recorded sessions, ensuring they don't miss out on valuable content even if they couldn't attend the event in real time. This feature enhances the overall experience and extends the reach of your events within the Metaverse platform.
