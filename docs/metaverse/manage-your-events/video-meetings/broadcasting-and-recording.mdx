If you have already [created a meeting](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/video-meetings/create-a-meeting), [created a channel](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/metaverse-tv/create-a-channel), and [configured a screen](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-metaverse/customize-your-metaverse/types-of-models/videos-and-screens), you can broadcast your conference to your audience within the metaverse.

To start broadcasting, head to the **Video meetings** section of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mext.app/metaverse), and click on the **Monitor** icon:

You can select either :

- **Record** : you can record your meeting, you'll find it in your meeting's recordings.
- **Broadcast** : if you wish to stream your meeting live, this is what you need. It will ask you on what **channel** you wish to broadcast. [You can learn more about channels](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/metaverse-tv/how-channels-work) or [how to create one](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/metaverse-tv/create-a-channel).
- **Record & Broadcast** : get the best of both worlds ðŸŽ‰
