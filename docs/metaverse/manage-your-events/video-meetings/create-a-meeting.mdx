This ensures that your meetings can run smoothly without the need for constant extensions or interruptions.\
> \
> Conduct Technical Tests: For meetings organized specifically for live sessions, it is highly advisable to conduct technical tests beforehand. These tests help ensure that your guests can actively participate in the meeting without encountering any firewall restrictions, especially if they are using professional devices. Test the functionality of their microphone, camera, and screen sharing features with their respective devices and web browsers. It is recommended to prioritize using Google Chrome for the best compatibility and performance.\
