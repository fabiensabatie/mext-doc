Once you have [created a meeting](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/video-meetings/create-a-meeting), click on the **Monitor** icon :

From there, you will be able to enjoy the following features:

- **Room Lock**: This feature allows the host to lock a meeting room, preventing additional participants from joining. Once locked, only those who are already in the meeting can continue to participate, and new participants cannot enter until the host unlocks the room.
- **Kick and Eject Participants**: As a host or moderator, you have the ability to remove participants from the meeting. The "Kick" option temporarily removes a participant, while the "Eject" option permanently removes them from the meeting. This feature helps to address disruptive or unwanted participants.
- **Mute and Unmute Participants**: The host or moderator can mute individual participants or all participants at once. This feature is useful in scenarios where background noise or disruptions need to be minimized, or when controlling the flow of conversation during the meeting.
- **Raise Hand**: Jitsi provides a "Raise Hand" feature that allows participants to virtually raise their hand to get the attention of the host or indicate that they have something to say. This helps maintain order during discussions and allows for a more organized conversation.
- **Moderator Controls**: The host has access to additional moderator controls, including the ability to grant moderator status to other participants. Moderators have enhanced privileges, such as the ability to mute or remove participants, change room settings, and manage other moderation features.
- **Lobby Mode**: Lobby mode requires participants to wait in a virtual lobby before entering the meeting. The host or moderator has the ability to admit participants one by one or all at once. This feature helps prevent unauthorized participants from joining and provides an extra layer of security.
- **Recording Notifications**: When a meeting is being recorded, Jitsi notifies all participants in the meeting. This transparency ensures that participants are aware of the recording and can act accordingly.

You can also choose from the **Moderator options** in the **Settings** panel of the meeting.
