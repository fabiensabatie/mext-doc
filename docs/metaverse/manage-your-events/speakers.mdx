This section allows you to build your speakers' database and seamlessly incorporate them into your events. By adding speakers to your database and assigning them to specific events, you can showcase their information on event webpages and programs, enhancing the overall experience for attendees.

## Add speakers

When adding a speaker, you will be prompted for the following information :

* The speaker's **first name** and **last name**.
* The speaker's **email** for communication purposes.
* Select the appropriate **booth** if the speaker is associated with one.
* Include the speaker's **job title** for proper identification.
* Specify the speaker's **affiliated company or organization**.
* Add a comprehensive **biography** to provide attendees with relevant background information.
* Upload a **professional picture** of the speaker to personalize their profile.
* Optionally, upload the **company logo** to further enhance the speaker's representation.

By completing these details, you can create a comprehensive speaker profile that will be displayed on the event webpage and program. This allows attendees to gain valuable insights into the expertise and background of each speaker, fostering engagement and enriching the overall event experience.

> Recommendations: It is important to note that in order to add someone as a speaker, they must be registered on the Metaverse platform. Prior to adding individuals as speakers, ensure that they have completed the registration process and have an active account. This ensures a smooth and seamless integration of speakers into your events and avoids any complications or issues related to their participation. By having all speakers registered on the platform, you can effectively manage their profiles and ensure a seamless experience for both speakers and attendees.
