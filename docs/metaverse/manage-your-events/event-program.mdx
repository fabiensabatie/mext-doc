## Creating a program

Before creating a program, make sure to [create an event](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/create-your-events) first. Programs allow you to control multiple aspects of your user's visit:

- Define the type of user experience: [watching a live stream](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-metaverse/customize-your-metaverse/types-of-models/videos-and-screens), participating in a networking or speed dating event.
- Redirect users to a specific zone of the Metaverse for the duration of the event.

To create a program, head to **Event Program** on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mext.app/metaverse), select an event, then click **Add new program**

- **Title**: Specify the title of your program.
- **Start Date**: When the program starts.
- **End Date**: When the program ends.
- **Description**: Include a description of program to be displayed in the metaverse.
- **Type**: Can be either **Break**, **Live session**, **Video meeting**, **Open networking** or **Speed networking**. [More information here about the types of program](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/event-program#types-of-programs).
- **Speakers**: Select one or more [speaker](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/speakers) for the event.
- **Status**: **Draft** or **Final**. If the status is set to draft, then the program won't be published yet.

Then click on **Confirm** to create the program.

## Types of programs

- **Break**: Specify break details, including start and end times. You can add moderators if it's an animated break.
- **Live Session**: [Real-time interactions with participants and speakers](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/video-meetings/create-a-meeting#adding-a-meeting). Select a previously created channel, speaker(s), and add the time slot. Remember to switch to "Final" mode when making the program public.
- **Video Meeting**: [Similar to regular video conferencing meetings](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/video-meetings/create-a-meeting#adding-a-meeting), select a previously created meeting, speaker(s), and add the time slot. Switch to "Final" mode when ready.
- **Open Networking**: [Informal and spontaneous networking sessions in 3D](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/speed-networking). Select a previously created session, speaker(s), and add the time slot. Switch to "Final" mode when making the program public.
- **Speed Networking**: [Structured networking for efficient introductions](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/speed-networking). Select a previously created session, speaker(s), and add the time slot. Switch to "Final" mode when you're ready to share the program.

> With these steps, you can craft a comprehensive event program tailored to your needs and audience."
