# Speed Networking session:

"Speed networking is a widely employed strategy at conferences, business networking gatherings, and job fairs, aimed at swiftly expanding participants' professional networks. It proves to be an efficient approach for breaking the ice, initiating conversations, and identifying potential synergies or collaboration opportunities. In the Mext format, a structured schedule is implemented, wherein each participant engages in a set of one-to-one meetings, comprising 7 minutes of interaction followed by a 3-minute break before moving on to the next participant.

Participation in Speed Networking requires prior registration. Participants receive a personalized agenda 48 hours before the event, outlining exact time slots and the individuals they will meet during each slot. The participant list remains unchanged within this 48-hour window.
The matchmaking process is automated using AI, generating schedules automatically and delivering them to participants via email. Additionally, notifications are scheduled to remind participants of their timing.
