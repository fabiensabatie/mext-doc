# How channels work

The same way it works for a TV, channels allow you to [stream content to a screen](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-metaverse/customize-your-metaverse/types-of-models/videos-and-screens). Within the metaverse, here is how channels are used :

A(<a href='/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/create-your-events'>You create an event</a>)
B(<a href='/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/metaverse-tv/create-a-channel'>You create a channel</a>)
C(<a href='/docs/metaverse/manage-your-metaverse/customize-your-metaverse/types-of-models/videos-and-screens'>You insert a video player in the metaverse, and configure it to use your channel</a>)
D(The visitors watch your stream)
A --> B
B --> C
C --> D
```

<br />

Mext uses the RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) protocol for streaming audio, video, and data over the internet. RTMP is widely supported by [various streaming platforms and software](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-events/metaverse-tv/how-channels-work#streaming-software), and you are free to use any of those for your specific purpose.

Each channel is created with a **source URL**, and **broadcast URL** and a **broadcast stream key**.

- The **broadcast URL** is the <span class="text-xs">_rtmp://_</span> link that you will insert into your streaming software. It is the receiving end of your stream.
- The **broadcast stream key** is a type of passphrase that is used to secure your stream. You will also need to insert it into your streaming software.
- The **source URL** is the <span class="text-xs">_https://_</span> webpage where users can visualize your stream. It can be accessed directly inside your browser or included into an [Iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)

```mermaid

```
