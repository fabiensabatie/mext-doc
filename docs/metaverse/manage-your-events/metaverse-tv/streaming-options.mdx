# **Livestream / Broadcast setup**

With the Mext platform, you have the capability to live stream and broadcast your sessions directly from your 3D immersive space and Metaverse to an extensive audience, potentially reaching thousands of viewers. Utilizing the video panels within the Metabuilder, you can create one or multiple screens, adjust their size, and position them within your space.
These screens can then be linked to specific broadcasting channels, enabling seamless streaming to a large and diverse audience.

> To ensure optimal live streaming experience, we strongly recommend creating dedicated channels for each live stream destination you plan to utilize. If you intend to use platforms like YouTube as an alternative to the Mext Live stream system, it is advisable to create a separate channel exclusively dedicated to YouTube.

### Multiple live stream sessions in parallel

To successfully host multiple live stream sessions concurrently, it is essential to establish a dedicated channel for each session. This approach ensures optimal streaming performance and enables independent broadcasting of the content for each session. By creating or acquiring a channel for each live session, you can proficiently manage and deliver simultaneous live streams, ensuring a seamless and immersive experience for your audience.
