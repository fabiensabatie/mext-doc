#### To effectively set up your channel, follow these steps:

1\.	Channel Name: Include a distinctive name for your channel to provide clarity and attract viewers.

2\.	Channel Description: Craft a compelling description that accurately portrays the purpose and content of your channel, enticing potential viewers.

3\.	Source URL: The Source URL serves as a direct link for viewers to access the livestream. 

4\.	Generating Channel Links: Clicking on "Generate a channel" will generate links to broadcast using the Mext broadcasting system.

5\.	Using External Broadcasting Systems: If you wish to use alternative systems like YouTube or Twitch for broadcasting, manually add the RTMP URL of the respective system to the "Broadcast URL" field. Additionally, insert the stream key links of the chosen system into the "Broadcast stream key" field.

6\.	Channel Creation and Management: Once the necessary information is provided, your new channel will be created. You can then edit and update the channel information as needed. Multiple channels can be created to accommodate different content or sessions.

#### Channel vs. Stages (Video meetings or any other gathering to be broadcasted):

1\.	1 Channel, 1 Stage: A single channel is dedicated to hosting one stage (video meeting).

2\.	1 Channel, 1 Stage : To organize a multichannel setup, contact Mext for assistance after setting up a channel and stage meeting at contact\@mext.app.

3\.	X Channels, X Meetings: You have the flexibility to create multiple channels and corresponding meetings based on your requirements.

>  Always ensure that your channel has the correct URL and stays synchronized with the meeting streaming interface to provide a seamless viewing experience for your audience.
