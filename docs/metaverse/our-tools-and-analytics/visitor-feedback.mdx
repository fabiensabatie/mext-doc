# Visitor feedback

Visitors in the Metaverse can easily convey their feedback and inquiries to the organizers through the Support/Feedback button found within the top menu. Organizers can access and review this feedback to ensure participant satisfaction and address any issues promptly.

## Managing Visitor Feedback

- Access the Visitor's Feedback button to review submissions from event participants.
- Detailed feedback can be examined by clicking on the eye icon.
- Organizers can respond directly to the feedback using the pencil icon, which facilitates creating an email response to address visitor concerns or questions.

This tool is essential for maintaining an open channel of communication with visitors and enhancing their experience within the Metaverse.
