# **Visitor feedback**

Visitors can easily **communicate their feedback and inquiries** with you through the Support/Feedback button located in the **top menu** within your 3D interactive space and metaverse. When you select the **Visitor's Feedback button**, you can access their input. Furthermore, clicking on the **eye icon** allows you to examine the detailed contents of the visitor's feedback, and if you click the pencil icon, you can promptly respond to their messages.
