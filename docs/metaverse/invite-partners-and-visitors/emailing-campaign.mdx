# Emailing Campaigns

The platform enables you to conduct email campaigns directly within the Metaverse back office. You can engage with your attendees or members, providing updates, news, or marketing materials.

## Managing Your Campaigns

You can target your campaigns to two types of recipient lists:

1. **Entire Attendee List**: Select and send your campaign to all your registered members.
2. **Customized List**: Build your recipient list by selecting individuals and send your campaign to this tailored group.
   - Sort the list of attendees by specific event to target particular subsets within your Metaverse.

Once you have your list tailored to your needs, follow these steps:

- Specify the title of your email.
- Craft the body content and text of the email according to your campaign goals.
- Add your email signature or official sign-off.
- Send the email to your prepared list of attendees or members.

> Email campaigns are a vital tool in enhancing engagement, informing participants about upcoming activities, and maintaining ongoing communication within the Metaverse community.
