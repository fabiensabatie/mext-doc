# **Emailing campaign**

You have the capability to conduct your email campaigns directly from the platform. Here's how you can manage your campaigns:

**1.	You can send campaigns to all your registered attendees or members by selecting the entire list and sending the campaign.**

**2.	Alternatively, you can build your recipient list by individually selecting attendees or members and then send your campaign to this customized list.**

**3.	If needed, you can sort the list of registered attendees for a specific event and launch a campaign targeted specifically to this group.**

### Once your recipient list is prepared, proceed with your emailing campaign:

* Begin by specifying the title of your email.
* Craft the content and text of your email.
* Add your signature to the email.
* Finally, send the email to your selected audience.
