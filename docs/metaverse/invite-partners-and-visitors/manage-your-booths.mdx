# Partners management (exhibitors)

## Manage partners spaces (stands) 

Enhance your partners' and exhibitors' presence in your 3D immersive space and metaverse by providing them with dedicated spaces and stands. As the organizer and owner, you have the power to easily create and assign these spaces within your 3D immersive environment and metaverse. Once a partner space or booth is generated, the corresponding Backoffice is dynamically created in real-time and promptly shared with your partner via email.

When you click on 'Manage Partner Spaces,' you'll find a detailed list of all your partner spaces and stands. Effortlessly search by name, ID, company, and more for quick access.
