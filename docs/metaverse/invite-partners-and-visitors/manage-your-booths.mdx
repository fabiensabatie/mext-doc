# Partners management (exhibitors)

## Manage partners spaces (stands) 

Enhance your partners' and exhibitors' presence in your 3D immersive space and metaverse by providing them with dedicated spaces and stands. As the organizer and owner, you have the power to easily create and assign these spaces within your 3D immersive environment and metaverse. Once a partner space or booth is generated, the corresponding Backoffice is dynamically created in real-time and promptly shared with your partner via email.

When you click on 'Manage Partner Spaces,' you'll find a detailed list of all your partner spaces and stands. Effortlessly search by name, ID, company, and more for quick access.

### Available Options for Partner Spaces and Stands

Currently, you have two options for your partners and exhibitors “Pre-designed stands” and “Custom stand/spaces design”:

### Pre-designed Stands: 

Partners can choose from three available booth types and set them up immediately without assistance. However, they cannot modify the booth's shape and can only add elements like panels, posters, videos, or 3D elements. This offers a quick solution, allowing them to have their booth set up in less than an hour. A pre-designed partner’s space and stand comes with a dedicated partners’ dedicated Backoffice.

## The available stand types include:

### 1. Silver Stand 

The silver stand is the smallest option, featuring one side where you can display 1 video and 2 poster panels.

## Custom Stand Design: 

As an administrator, you have the flexibility to engage with your partners to understand their specific requirements. Utilizing the Metabuilder tool, you can customize one of the existing booth types (Silver, Gold, or Platinum) to align with their unique design preferences. This empowers you to oversee the overall aesthetics of your partners' spaces and booths within your 3D immersive space and Metaverse, offering avenues for monetization as well.
