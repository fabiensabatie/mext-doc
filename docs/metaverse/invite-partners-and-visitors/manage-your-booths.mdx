# Partners management (exhibitors)

## Manage partners spaces (stands)

Enhance your partners' and exhibitors' presence in your 3D immersive space and metaverse by providing them with dedicated spaces and stands.

## Create a partner space

### Available Options for Partner Spaces and Stands

Currently, you have two options for your partners and exhibitors “Pre-designed stands” and “Custom stand/spaces design”:

### Pre-designed Stands:

Partners can choose from three available booth types and set them up immediately without assistance. However, they cannot modify the booth's shape and can only add elements like panels, posters, videos, or 3D elements. This offers a quick solution, allowing them to have their booth set up in less than an hour. A pre-designed partner’s space and stand comes with a dedicated partners’ dedicated Backoffice.

## The available stand types include:

### 1. Silver Booth

The silver stand is the smallest option, featuring one side where you can display 1 video and 2 poster panels.

It's particularly convenient for startups with limited content or to be used as a reception desk.

### 2.	Gold Booth

The Gold stand is of medium size, consisting of 2 parts:

* A.	An external part, or the showcase, displayed within the main immersive 3D space and metaverse exhibition. It features 1 large video screen, 1 large panel, and smaller additional panels.

* B.	A private showroom accessible to visitors via a click-through option. Here, partners and exhibitors can meet privately. The showroom is fully customizable, allowing partners and exhibitors to add panels and 3D objects as desired.

### 3.	Platinum Booth

Platinum Stand The Platinum Stand is our most prestigious pre-designed stand, featuring:

* A.	An imposing external showcase with a large video panel and 12 additional panels.

* B.	A spacious private showroom accessible to visitors with a simple click-through option. Within this larger space, partners and exhibitors can meet privately. The showroom comprises multiple distinct areas and is fully customizable, allowing partners and exhibitors to add panels and 3D objects as desired.

## Custom Booth Design:

As an administrator, you have the flexibility to engage with your partners to understand their specific requirements. Utilizing the Metabuilder tool, you can customize one of the existing booth types (Silver, Gold, or Platinum) to align with their unique design preferences. This empowers you to oversee the overall aesthetics of your partners' spaces and booths within your 3D immersive space and Metaverse, offering avenues for monetization as well.

> IMPORTANT: Ensure that the partner’s space and booth owner is registered before proceeding with booth creation.

Complete the form, choose the type (Silver, Gold, or Platinum), and confirm. An email containing the booth interface link is promptly dispatched to the exhibitor (stand owner), enabling them to upload content and manage the newly created stand.

> Simply creating a new partner space and stand doesn't automatically make it visible to the audience. To showcase it within your 3D immersive space and Metaverse, you must position your partner's space inside using the Metabuilder. This task can only be carried out by the Metaverse Administrator and isn't accessible to partners and exhibitors.

### **Partner’s and Exhibitor’s Backoffice**

This section of the documentation is designed to assist your exhibitors and partners in editing and managing their dedicated space and stands.

### **Introduction to Partner’s Backoffice**

> Within the dynamic realm of Mext Platform's 3D immersive space and Metaverse, administrators hold the authority to design dedicated spaces for partners, shaping the environment into an immersive ecosystem for a diverse range of partners and visitors.

> Partners, encompassing companies or independent entities within the 3D space and Metaverse, possess dedicated space inside the 3D immersive space and Metaverse and are equipped with their own Backoffice. This empowers them to independently manage content and visitors within the 3D immersive space and Metaverse under the governance of the administrator. Whether serving as exhibitors with stands in Metaverse Exhibitions or boutique owners in Metaverse Malls, partners engage in various use cases.

> Partner spaces, spanning from stands and booths to boutiques and more, are dynamically generated by the 3D space and Metaverse administrator. While providing default configurations, partners have the freedom to customize these spaces to align with their specific preferences and use cases. This customization extends to personalizing the 3D environment, interactivity, and other relevant elements, accessible through the Partner and exhibitor interface, also known as the Partner and exhibitor Backoffice.

> Partners and exhibitors possess the authority to manage and customize their spaces, stands, and associated showrooms. However, it's essential to note that they lack the ability to place and position these elements within the 3D immersive space and Metaverse or modify their shape and size without assistance from the administrator. Specific actions, such as placement and alterations to external aspects, remain exclusive to the administrator's purview.

> This comprehensive document offers essential guidance for partners and exhibitors within a 3D immersive space and Metaverse, enabling them to effectively manage and personalize their dedicated spaces within the 3D immersive space and Metaverse.
