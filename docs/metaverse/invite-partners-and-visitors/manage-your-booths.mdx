In the context of exhibitions or fairs, you can create customized spaces for partners. You can later include those spaces into your metaverse. Booths are templates that can be personalized by others. You can create a booth, select it's **grade** (either _silver_, _gold_, or _platinum_), then let others customize it.

Using the booths is **not limited to the use case of exhibitions**, wether you need a space for each your students for presentations, customizable spaces for advertising, **let your imagination run wild ✨**.

## Adding a booth

To get started, head to the **Manage your booths** feature under the **Manage exhibitors and visitors** section of [your dashboard](https://dashboard.mext.app/metaverse).

You only need three elements to create a booth :

- **Organization name**: The company's or organization's name.
- **Administrator email**: The email of the person who will administer the booth.
- **Type**: Either **silver**, **gold**, or **platinum**.

> An email is immediately sent to the exhibitor (booth owner) with the booth interface link to start to upload content and manage the created booth.

⚠ Creating a new booth is not enough to automatically make it visible to your audience. You need to place it in your Metaverse through [the metaverse builder](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-metaverse/customize-your-metaverse/metaverse-editor). This can be done only by Metaverse Administrator and cannot be done by the booth owner.

Once you've created booths, you can export them by clicking on **Export to CSV**.

## Types of booths

We have create three types of booth.

### Silver

### Gold

### Platinum

> As metaverse admin, you have a moderator role for booths and you can delete partially the content of a booth through the exhibitor or delete completely the booth.
