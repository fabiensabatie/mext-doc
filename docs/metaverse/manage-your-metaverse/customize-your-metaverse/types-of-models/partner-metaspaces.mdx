# Partner stands & exhibitors

In the context of exhibitions, you can create customized spaces for partners. You can later include those spaces into your metaverse. First you need to [create a stand, and customize it](/docs/metaverse/invite-partners-and-visitors/manage-your-booths).

## Adding the stands to your metaverse

To get started, click on the **<span style={{color: "green", fontSize: "40px"}}>+</span>** button located in the toolbar on the left side of the builder. In the new window, search for **Partner spaces**. You can select **multiple stands at once**. Once you have chosen which stands to insert, click on **Add**.

> Note: All the stands are inserted in the middle of the scene, coordinates **(0, 0, 0)**

Once the stand has been added, you can move it around and rotate it.

## Other use cases

Stands are templates that are assignable to other people (or yourself), partly customizable, and reusable. You can use them for any kind of content display. From advertising to science fairs, let your imagination run wild and collaborate with people to create a unique metaverse.
