In the **Customize your metaverse** section, you have the opportunity to shape your metaverse and add various elements such as 3D spaces, buildings, decorations, and floating photos for advertisements. These elements can be arranged in a neat and visually appealing manner. To assist you in this process, the following tools are available:

## Editing a model

Each model within your metaverse is editable. Depending on your plan, you are given different levels of flexibility. From editing the screens only to fully customizing your metaverse.

### Translate

This option allows you to move and position the added elements with XYZ coordinates. You can use the blue and red arrows to move stands and decorative elements horizontally (right to left, front to back), while the green arrow allows you to lift and suspend objects in the air. For example, in the image below, the banana tree is positioned using the red and blue arrows and suspended using the green arrow.

## Adding a model

This option allows you to add new elements to your metaverse. You can choose from a wide range of models, including buildings, spaces administered by partners, and decorative elements. You can also add floating photos for advertisements and **add your custom models**.

To get started, click on the **<span style={{color: "green", fontSize: "40px"}}>+</span>** button located in the toolbar on the left side of the builder. In the new window, you can choose from the following options: **Models**, **Import a model**, **Stands**, select **Import a model**

- **Name**: Specify the name of your model.
- **Thumbnail**: Upload a thumbnail image for your model.
- **Model**: Provide the model as a **GLB** or **FBX** file.

Once you click confirm, you can track your upload. It will let you know when the model is ready, and insert it into your scene for you.

## Undo / Redo

- Undo: If you're not satisfied with a previous action, you can use this option to cancel and revert it.
- Redo: This option allows you to restore actions that were previously undone.

## Properties editor

This window allows you to edit the properties of the selected model. You can change the material, texture, and coordinates of the model. Each type of model has its own set of properties.

The properties editor shows up on all editable elements. You can drag and move it by clicking on the ðŸ“Œ.

## Model features

### Examinable

<div class="flex-row">
  <div class="plan">Discovery plan</div>
  <div class="plan">Explorer plan</div>
  <div class="plan">Professional plan</div>
  <div class="plan">Custom plan</div>
</div>

Under **Features** in the [properties editor](/docs/metaverse/manage-your-metaverse/customize-your-metaverse/metaverse-editor#properties-editor), you will find the **Examinable** option. An examinable model can be rotated and zoomed in on. It is a great way to showcase a product or a piece of art.
Visitors have the ability to interact with your model by simply clicking on it, enabling them to rotate and view it from various angles. This feature is especially valuable for showcasing products or art pieces, allowing users to explore and examine every aspect of the model for a more comprehensive understanding and appreciation."
