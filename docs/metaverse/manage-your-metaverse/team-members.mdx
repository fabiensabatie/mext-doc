Within the "Team Members" section, you have the ability to include individuals who will collaborate with you in managing the Metaverse. Once added, these individuals will be designated as administrators and granted the same rights and privileges as you. This includes the ability to edit, delete, moderate, and add other administrators.
To add a member as an administrator, simply click on "Add new admin", enter their email address, and confirm the addition. It's important to note that for someone to assume the admin role, they must already be registered on the Mext platform.

> Recommendations: When adding members to your Metaverse Admin, it is essential to choose individuals whom you trust implicitly to assist you in monitoring activities and managing sensitive information, including visitor lists, partner details, and Metaverse statistics.

> Regularly reviewing the list of Metaverse Admin members is also crucial. Take the time to assess whether all current members are still necessary and actively involved in the management process. If someone is no longer required or has changed roles, it is advisable to remove them from the Metaverse Admin to maintain an up-to-date and secure team.
