Scene Management is exclusively available with the "Professional" and "Custom Metaverse" packages, which offer multiple scenes. This feature allows you to create and work on multiple independent scenes simultaneously, as well as handle multiple projects concurrently.

* **Name**: Specify the name of your scene.
* **Status**: Choose whether it should be private or public. Select "public" if you want everyone to have access, or "private" if access should be limited to those who receive a specific link from you. Privacy can also be useful during the development stage when the metaverse is not yet ready to be viewed.
* **Pick a template**: Select a template to use for your scene. You can choose from a variety of templates.
