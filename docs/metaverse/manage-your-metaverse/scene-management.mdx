## Add a scene

* **Name**: Specify the name of your scene.
* **Status**: Choose whether it should be private or public. Select "public" if you want everyone to have access, or "private" if access should be limited to those who receive a specific link from you. Privacy can also be useful during the development stage when the metaverse is not yet ready to be viewed.
* **Pick a template**: Select a template to use for your scene. You can choose from a variety of templates.

Here are a few recommendations to keep in mind:

> Please note that each scene has a maximum limit of 50 stands (administrated by partners). It is advised not to exceed this number to maintain a smooth experience for visitors, avoiding any potential lag or sluggish movements.
