# Program Creation

The “Event Program” feature empowers you to create and showcase your event program, making it accessible both on the event page and within the Metaverse via the 'Program' button. You have the flexibility to commence building your program at any time and unveil it when it's fully confirmed, completed, and the right time arrives.

4\.	Program Item Details: For each program item, provide the following details:

* Title of the session.
* Short description.
* Type of session (You have four options):

	Break: Specify break details, including start and end times. You can add moderators if it's an animated break.
