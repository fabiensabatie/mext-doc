# Program Creation

The “Event Program” feature empowers you to create and showcase your event program, making it accessible both on the event page and within the Metaverse via the 'Program' button. You have the flexibility to commence building your program at any time and unveil it when it's fully confirmed, completed, and the right time arrives.
