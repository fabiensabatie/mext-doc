### Introduction to the scoring system

In the 3D immersive space and Metaverse, the scoring system plays a pivotal role in evaluating participant performance and fostering engagement. It assigns numerical values or points to various actions and achievements, enabling the creation of challenges, provision of rewards, and allowing participants to track their progress, compete with others, and set personal improvement goals. These scoring systems come in various forms and serve several essential functions.

Within the Mext Metaverse platform, the key principle is flexibility, allowing for the assignment of specific point values to a diverse range of actions contributing to a participant's overall score. There exists an extensive list of categorized actions, each associated with its own point values, which can be customized to align with scoring objectives. For example, in an Exhibition Metaverse aimed at incentivizing community attendance at conferences, high scores can be assigned to conference-related actions such as attending sessions, actively participating in chat discussions, and more. Similarly, for educational journeys, scores can be allocated for quizzes, games, and other relevant activities. Additionally, scores can be assigned for polls and other interactions within the 3D interactive spaces and Metaverse.

This adaptable scoring approach empowers users to tailor the Metaverse experience to specific goals, encouraging meaningful engagement and competition among participants. It provides a dynamic way to measure and reward contributions within the virtual realm, enhancing the overall experience.
