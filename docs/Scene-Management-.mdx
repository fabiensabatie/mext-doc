Scene Management is exclusively available with the "Professional" and "Custom Metaverse" packages, which offer multiple scenes. This feature allows you to create and work on multiple independent scenes simultaneously, as well as handle multiple projects concurrently.

To add a new scene, simply click on the "Add new scene" button.
