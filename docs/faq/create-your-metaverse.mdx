2.3.12	How Can an Exhibitor Manage a Booth in the Metaverse?

When a booth is created in the Metaverse, a dedicated Backoffice is generated specifically for that booth. This booth Backoffice serves as a robust control panel for exhibitors, offering a variety of tools and functionalities to customize their booth and track important metrics.

With the booth Backoffice, exhibitors have the flexibility to personalize various elements of their booth to reflect their branding and achieve their objectives. They can effortlessly upload and showcase images, videos, 3D models, and interactive content that highlight their products or services. Exhibitors can also rearrange and resize components within the booth to create an immersive and visually captivating experience.

In addition to customization, the booth Backoffice provides exhibitors with valuable insights into the performance of their booth. Real-time visitor data and statistics, such as the number of visitors, engagement levels, and visit durations, are readily available. This data empowers exhibitors to assess the effectiveness of their booth and make informed decisions to optimize their presence in the Metaverse.

Moreover, the Backoffice offers powerful communication tools that facilitate direct interaction between exhibitors and visitors. Features like chat functionality, video/audio calls, and spatial audio with avatars enable exhibitors to engage in real-time conversations and address inquiries or requests from visitors. They can also set up Q\&A sessions, interactive games, and offer digital goodies to enhance attendee engagement.

By leveraging the booth Backoffice, exhibitors gain autonomy to personalize their booths, monitor visitor data, and actively engage with attendees. This level of control maximizes their presence and impact within the Metaverse, creating an immersive and memorable experience for both exhibitors and visitors.
