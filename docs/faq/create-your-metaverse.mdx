#### Can I make my Metaverse private or public?

Mext offers you the flexibility to control the accessibility of your Metaverse by toggling between public and private modes. Here's how it works:

**Public Metaverse:** When you set your Metaverse to public mode, it becomes visible on the Mext website and any other websites where you have embedded it. This means that anyone who comes across your Metaverse can click on it and enter without any access restrictions. It provides an open invitation for visitors to explore and engage with your virtual space.

**Private Metaverse:** If you prefer to limit access to your Metaverse, you can switch it to private mode. In this mode, only individuals who have the specific link to your Metaverse and have been registered as visitors by the Metaverse organizer can access it. This ensures that only authorized individuals can enter and experience your virtual environment.

By choosing between public and private modes, you have control over who can access and engage with your Metaverse. Public mode allows for maximum visibility and reach, while private mode ensures a more exclusive and controlled experience for selected visitors. You can switch between these modes at any time, depending on your specific requirements and the nature of your event or project.

#### How an exhibitor manages a booth in the Metaverse?

When the Metaverse organizer creates a booth in the Metaverse, a dedicated Backoffice is generated specifically for that booth. This booth Backoffice serves as a powerful control panel for exhibitors, offering a wide range of tools and functionalities to customize their booth and track important metrics.

With the booth Backoffice, exhibitors have the freedom to personalize various elements of their booth to reflect their branding and achieve their objectives.

#### What is a showroom and what is a stand?

A showroom in the context of the Metaverse refers to an interactive 3D space that can be embedded in a website or incorporated into a larger Metaverse environment. It serves as a dedicated space for showcasing products, services, or experiences in a visually engaging and immersive manner.

On the other hand, a stand is specifically associated with the Metaverse Expo use case. In this scenario, the Metaverse organizer allocates stands to exhibitors within the Expo. A stand typically consists of two parts:

1. Vitrine: The vitrine is the visible part of the stand that is accessible to Expo visitors. Exhibitors have the ability to change the content within the vitrine, such as images, videos, or interactive elements. However, the size and overall frame of the vitrine are predetermined and cannot be altered by the exhibitor.
2. Showroom: The showroom is the second part of the stand, which is not directly visible to Expo visitors. It provides exhibitors with the flexibility to fully customize the interior of their showroom space. This includes the layout, design, placement of objects, and interactive elements. The showroom serves as a private area where exhibitors can create a personalized and immersive experience for their visitors.

By offering both the vitrine and showroom components, the Metaverse Expo enables exhibitors to effectively showcase their offerings to a wide audience while also providing them with the opportunity to create a more tailored and immersive experience within their showrooms. This combination of public visibility and private customization enhances the exhibitor's ability to engage with Expo visitors and make a lasting impression

#### What is the difference between a stand, a hall, a metaverse ?

A metaverse is a comprehensive virtual environment that encompasses various components, including an organizer backoffice. The structure and features of a metaverse can vary based on the chosen package. It can consist of a single scene or multiple scenes, each offering different interactive capabilities.

In the context of a metaverse expo, a hall refers to a specific scene within the metaverse. It serves as a designated area where partners' stands can be set up, and conferences can be organized and managed. A metaverse can have multiple halls, each designed to accommodate different exhibitors and activities.

A stand, on the other hand, is directly associated with the metaverse expo use case. It represents the space allocated by the expo organizer to exhibitors for showcasing their products and services. Stands are typically located within the halls of the metaverse and serve as individual showcases for exhibitors. A single hall can accommodate several stands, providing exhibitors with the opportunity to present their offerings in a collective setting.

#### How to add a live session screen in my metaverse if there are no screens?

With Mext, live sessions can be either meetings or livestreaming sessions. Livestreaming is exclusively available for Explorer and Professional packages, adding an extra layer of value. When livestreaming is included in your package, you have the ability to place screens or multiple screens within your Metaverse, enabling you to broadcast captivating livestream content.

For meetings without livestreaming, the experience differs based on the type of meeting:

1. Avatars Meeting/Gathering: For Avatars meetings or gatherings, simply provide a link or teleport location in the Metaverse to instantly transport participants to the event. This immersive feature ensures seamless connectivity and engagement.
2. Video Meetings: In the case of video meetings, a link or teleport location in the Metaverse allows you to open another browser window to join the meeting, similar to popular platforms like Zoom or Google Meet. To stay updated with the Metaverse activities, you can switch between windows. When it's time to showcase the Metaverse content, screen sharing during the video meeting allows you to display the Metaverse window to all participants.

#### What are the advantages of Broadcasting compare to Share Screen?

Broadcasting and sharing screens are two different methods used for transmitting information in various contexts, such as online meetings, webinars, or live events. While both approaches have their own benefits, broadcasting offers some distinct advantages compared to screen sharing:

1. Scale and Reach: Broadcasting allows you to reach a large audience simultaneously. With broadcasting, you can transmit your message to numerous participants without requiring each person to connect individually or share their screens. This is particularly beneficial for events or presentations where the goal is to disseminate information to a wide audience efficiently.
2. Bandwidth Efficiency: Broadcasting requires significantly less bandwidth compared to screen sharing. When you share your screen, the actual content being displayed on your screen is transmitted in real-time to each participant. This can consume considerable bandwidth, especially if you're sharing high-resolution videos or complex visuals. Broadcasting, on the other hand, typically involves a single stream of the content being transmitted to all viewers, resulting in reduced bandwidth requirements.
3. Participant Focus: Broadcasting allows participants to focus solely on the content being presented, without any distractions caused by other participants' screens or activities. Screen sharing often involves displaying one participant's screen at a time, and viewers may be distracted by notifications, background applications, or accidental screen switching. Broadcasting ensures a consistent viewing experience for all participants, reducing potential distractions.
4. Professional Presentation: Broadcasting provides a more polished and professional presentation format. It allows you to curate the content, adjust the layout, and incorporate additional elements like graphics, lower-thirds, or pre-recorded videos to enhance the overall viewing experience. This level of control over the presentation can contribute to a more engaging and impactful delivery.
5. Resource Utilization: Broadcasting requires fewer system resources compared to screen sharing. Screen sharing can be resource-intensive, as it involves capturing the entire screen or specific applications in real-time. This can lead to increased CPU and memory usage, potentially affecting the performance of the presenter's device. Broadcasting relies on dedicated broadcasting software or services that are designed to efficiently handle the transmission of content, reducing the impact on the presenter's system.

It's important to note that the choice between broadcasting and screen sharing depends on the specific context and requirements of the situation. Screen sharing can be more suitable for collaborative work, interactive sessions, or situations where participants need to actively engage with the shared content. Broadcasting, on the other hand, excels in scenarios where information dissemination and audience reach are the primary objectives.
