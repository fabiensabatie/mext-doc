#### What is the difference between Mext platform and other competitors ?

Practically, the conventional search engines are not exactly neither B2B or context specific focused with particular domain. For example, Alibaba largely depends on Cloud data (they usually consider maximum diversified corpus of data instead of pinpointing a sector and its associated business eco-system) and prefers visual analytics over recommendations. Similarly, Netflix acts as normal recommender system, where concept of filtering user input and narrowing down search domain becomes functional. However, Mext has bi-focal objectives: it provides market expertise driven matching with the creation of knowledge center for each enterprises and supports with smart recommendations. It consults continuously to update the knowledge data profile and subsequently learning of data features while yielding more and more precise recommendations. In addition to, compared to all the other engines, Mext is different, it is specific, focused and market-oriented knowledge engine.

#### How could you position Mext Meatvesre from the perspectives of other search engines and support software systems like Google & ChatGPT in particular? 

ChatGPT is insanely good at generating human-like responses to queries and solving problems through textual conversations. On the other hand, Google is really good at finding information, videos, images, products, and almost anything on the internet. However, Mext Metvaerse is broadly different than two paradigms . Firstly, it is a contextual similarity matching platform for B2B domain, empowered with sophisticated, dynamic and more real-time knowledge corpus with B2B environment of diversified industrial domains even in fashion. Mext Metaverse is not restricted with normal information search for B2B like Google or Bing , rather it connects the « knowledge center » with different enterprises, their B2B practices and relations. In a simplified words its more powerful knowledge engine to support decision makers.

#### Is Mext highly data dependent to yield best Matchmaking services ? 

No it is not fully data dependent like other generic search engines. As Mext has a well –defined data pre-processing engine to accumulate, clean, extract and normalize whole corpus of diversified domain data across globe. Even, Mext is capable of generating certain co-relational data, which are not available through its data preprocessing algorithm (through calculation of mean values of data features and continuous regressions). Hence, unlikely it is not completely data dependent. The more it will be consolidating over next 2 years, Must-WIKI will be more enriched, clean and nose-free to boost the results towards precession.

#### Does Mext Matchmaking support more visual analysis of recommendations and matchmaking of B2B entities after process?

Mext matchmaking follows a novel approach of distributed deep learning, which itself indicates that real world industrial eco-system data could be improperly labelled and even misclassified: for example priority of data items for different data features present in company value chain corpus may not be exactly positioned. Mext matchmaking eliminates those non-linear and non-correlational data values automatically, while pre-processing the data itself to produce better results close to the market reality

#### Suppose my company wants to have some relevant matchmaking of business eco-system as initial start-up company (considering low profile in market) how Mext Metaverse will help me?

As mentioned, Mext-Metaverse is not fully data dependent, hence if your company is start up, based on the market knowledge and constraints to be provided to the MEXT AI algorithm it can support you to find most relevant and maximum likelihood business-ecosystem entitles for your start-up.
