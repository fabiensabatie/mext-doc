### 1.2.3	How to access to my agenda?

When you access your profile (link to 1.2.1 “How to access to your profile?”),, navigate to the menu on the left-hand side and click on "Agenda". This will direct you to your personalized agenda, where you can view and manage your scheduled events, appointments, and activities.

Leaving a message triggers email and Mext App notifications, ensuring they receive your message promptly, especially if they have the Mext App installed on their mobile device.

### 1.2.9	What is the difference between a 3D immersive space and Metaverse? 

The primary difference between a 3D immersive space and the Metaverse lies in their scope and functionality:

1\.	3D immersive Space:

* A 3D immersice space typically refers to a virtual environment where users can interact with digital content and each other in three-dimensional space. These spaces can range from simple virtual rooms or environments to complex simulations or immersive experiences. They are often designed for specific purposes such as meetings, events, training, or entertainment.

2\.	Metaverse:

* The Metaverse, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses interconnected virtual worlds and the internet as a whole. It represents a collective virtual shared space where users can interact, socialize, work, play, and engage in various activities across different platforms and environments. Unlike individual 3D spaces, the Metaverse aims to create a unified and persistent digital universe that transcends individual applications or experiences.

In summary, while a 3D immersive space is a specific virtual environment with interactive features, the Metaverse is a larger, interconnected network of virtual spaces, platforms, and experiences that aims to create a cohesive and immersive digital reality.

### 1.2.10	 What is the difference between a partner space and 3D immersive space? 

In essence, a 3D immersive space is a fully immersive digital environment managed by an administrator or group of administrators. 

A partner space, on the other hand, is a designated area within a 3D immersive space specifically allocated to a partner. The owner of the 3D immersive space creates and assigns these areas to partners, granting them their own administrator-specific backoffice for autonomous management.

Partner spaces are tailored for partners to showcase their products and services effectively. They can be utilized as digital exhibition booths in digital trade shows or as 3D eBoutiques within a digital shopping mall."

### 1.3	TROUBLESHOOTING
