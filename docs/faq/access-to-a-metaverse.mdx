These stands are strategically allocated by the Metaverse organizer and are commonly used in Metaverse Expos and trade fair scenarios.

The purpose of a stand is to provide partners with a designated area where they can showcase their offerings to a virtual audience. Similar to physical booths in traditional expos, stands in the Metaverse act as promotional spaces for partners to engage with visitors, present their products or services, and foster connections and business opportunities.

These features provide you with convenient ways to navigate and explore the Metaverse, whether it's by walking with your avatar or utilizing the map and teleportation options.

#### How many avatars can I see at the same time?

It's important to consider that the number of avatars visible simultaneously in the Metaverse can be influenced by factors such as network bandwidth, device capabilities, and the complexity of the environment. The Mext platform aims to strike a balance between accommodating a substantial number of avatars while maintaining optimal performance and ensuring a seamless experience for all participants.

In the case of the Mext platform, the configuration is set to allow a maximum of 50 avatars per scene or space. This limitation is in place to ensure that the platform can handle the interactions and activities of all participants effectively. However, even if the number of visible avatars is restricted, you still have the flexibility to connect and interact with other avatars by teleporting to them.

To teleport to other avatars, you can navigate to the sidebar and access the attendees list. There, you will see a list of attendees who are currently online, indicated by a green dot. If an attendee is within your network, you will notice a teleport sign next to their profile. By clicking on the teleport sign, you can instantly join them in their location within the Metaverse.

To add an attendee to your network, simply click on the "+" symbol on their profile. This establishes a connection between you and allows for easier teleportation and communication.

For precise information regarding the capacity and visibility of avatars in your specific Metaverse setup, it is advisable to consult the Mext platform support team at contact@mext.app or refer to the platform's documentation, which provides detailed information tailored to your specific use case.
