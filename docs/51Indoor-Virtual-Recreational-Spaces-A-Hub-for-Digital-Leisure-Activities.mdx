5.5	Mext platform versus competition 

5.5.1	What sets Mext apart from its competitors? 

Mext distinguishes itself in several key ways:

1\.	Extensibility: Mext is crafted as a versatile tool, aiming to expand the Metaverse concept into an immersive web environment. By augmenting users' current digital assets, it prepares them for the forthcoming era of the internet, Web3, which addresses various limitations of Web2, including concerns about data privacy, centralized control, and platform monopolies. While competitors may provide similar services, Mext's core mission is to empower individuals, companies, and organizations to enhance their digital assets and extend their presence in the Metaverse. Unlike several existing Metaverse platforms that often attempt to create dependency among users by tethering them to the platform's ecosystem and subjecting them to its traffic and regulations, Mext prioritizes user freedom and flexibility and is fully aligned with Web3 objectives. Leveraging MetaBuilder and AI technologies, Mext seamlessly transforms existing 2D websites into fully immersive 3D spaces, facilitating the adoption of immersive experiences and the evolution of the internet's next generation, providing a distinct advantage in the market.

2\.	AI-Powered Innovation: Mext integrates AI at its core, harnessing the power of neural networks for advanced matchmaking algorithms, analytics, and intelligent recommendations within the Metaverse. This inherent AI integration, including AI-Assistant technologies from OpenAI, offers unparalleled opportunities for leveraging Metaverse activities and driving continuous improvement. Mext is paving the way for simplified Metaverse and web3 adoption, where concepts can be realized with minimal effort.

3\.	Accessibility: Mext is dedicated to making the Metaverse accessible to everyone. By emphasizing inclusivity and democratization, Mext ensures that individuals, businesses, and organizations of all sizes can participate and benefit from its potential, setting it apart from competitors that may cater only to specific niches or industries.

5.6	AI-Powered innovation

5.6.1	What is the difference between Mext matchmakig-AI and similar marchmaking-AIs ?

Practically, the conventional search engines are not exactly neither B2B or context specific focused with particular domain.  For example, Alibaba largely depends on Cloud data (they usually consider maximum diversified corpus of data instead of pinpointing a sector and its associated business eco-system) and prefers visual analytics over recommendations. Similarly, Netflix acts as normal recommender system, where concept of filtering user input and narrowing down search domain becomes functional.  However, Mext  has bi-focal objectives: it provides market expertise driven matching  with the creation of knowledge center  for each enterprises and supports with smart recommendations. It consults continuously to update the knowledge data profile and subsequently learning of data features while yielding more and more precise recommendations.  In addition to, compared to all the other engines, Mext is different, it is specific, focused and market-oriented knowledge engine.

 

5.6.2	Is  Mext  highly data dependent  to    yield best Matchmaking services ? 

No it is not fully data dependent like other generic search engines. As Mext has a  well –defined data pre-processing  engine to  accumulate,  clean, extract and normalize whole corpus of diversified domain data across globe.  Even, Mext is capable of generating certain co-relational data, which are not available through its data preprocessing algorithm (through calculation of mean values of data features and continuous regressions). Hence, unlikely it is not completely data dependent.   The more it will be consolidating over next 2 years, Must-WIKI will be more enriched, clean and nose-free to boost the results towards precession.

5.6.3	Does Mext Matchmaking  support more visual analysis of recommendations   and matchmaking of B2B entities after process?

Mext matchmaking  follows a novel approach of distributed deep learning, which itself indicates that real world industrial eco-system data could be improperly labelled and even misclassified: for example  priority of  data items for different data features  present in company value chain  corpus may not be exactly positioned. Mext matchmaking  eliminates those non-linear and non-correlational data values  automatically, while pre-processing the data itself to produce better results close to the market reality.
