### 1.3	Troubleshooting

### 1.3.1	Is the Metaverse platform compatible with my device?

To ensure a smooth and enjoyable user experience on the Mext Platform, it is important to assess whether your laptop meets the minimum resource requirements, even though the platform has been optimized and does not heavily rely on game resources. The platform operates within a 3D environment, necessitating adequate hardware resources.

To determine if your device is compatible with the Metaverse, it is essential to verify the following factors:

Minimum hardware requirements:

* Processor: Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5, with a clock speed of 2.5 GHz or higher
* Memory: 8 GB RAM or an equivalent configuration
* Graphics: Integrated graphics card with UHD capability, preferably supplemented with a dedicated graphics card from Nvidia or AMD.

To test your laptop's hardware capabilities, you can utilize the following online tools:

* [https://whatsmygpu.com/](https://whatsmygpu.com/)
* [https://web.basemark.com/](https://web.basemark.com/)

Network requirements

Furthermore, a stable network connection is crucial for seamless performance within the Metaverse. Consider the following network recommendations:

* Download speed: Minimum of 10 Mbps (Megabits per second)
* Upload speed: Minimum of 2 Mbps

To evaluate your Wi-Fi speed, you can visit the following website:

Video/Audio calls (WebRTC)

In addition, if you plan to engage in video and audio calls using WebRTC technology, it is advisable to test your settings beforehand. You can use the following tool for this purpose:

Please note that the final two tests mentioned on the Twilio website, "Video: Test Group Room with Turn" and "Video: Test Group Room without Turn," are not mandatory for the assessment.

Browsers

For optimal, secure navigation and to take advantage of the latest technologies, we recommend you use the latest version of the following browsers: CHROME 2, EDGE 3 and FIREFOX.

Please be aware that:

* SAFARI is not recommended
* INTERNET EXPLORER does not work with our platform

Check Firewalls

If you are using a company laptop, it is important to ensure that there are no firewalls or restrictions in place that may prevent you from using external software. Many companies have security measures in the form of whitelists, which specify the software that can be installed or accessed on company devices.

Mobile APP

To access with mobile phone, we recommend downloading Mext Metaverse APP for both Android and iOS devices.
