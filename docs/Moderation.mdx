# **Moderation**

The moderation feature streamlines the gathering of visitor questions, including reports of abuse, via the Support/Feedback button. Visitors can select a category (booth, Metaverse, account, other) and a subcategory (technical, commercial, report abuse, other) for their questions, typing and sending them to the Metaverse administration back office.

As a Metaverse administrator, you receive an email when a visitor submits a question. You can access the question by clicking on the link in the email or by connecting to the administration back office and navigating to the 'Moderation' section.
