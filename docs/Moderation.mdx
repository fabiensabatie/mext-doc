# **Moderation**

The moderation feature streamlines the gathering of visitor questions, including reports of abuse, via the Support/Feedback button. Visitors can select a category (booth, Metaverse, account, other) and a subcategory (technical, commercial, report abuse, other) for their questions, typing and sending them to the Metaverse administration back office.

 

As a Metaverse administrator, you receive an email when a visitor submits a question. You can access the question by clicking on the link in the email or by connecting to the administration back office and navigating to the 'Moderation' section.

 

Within the 'Moderation' section:

 

•	Clicking on the pencil icon allows you to initiate the question follow-up process.

 

•	Change the status to 'In Progress' if you need time to answer later.

•	Alternatively, if you have an immediate response, answer and change the status to 'Closed' to conclude the question."
