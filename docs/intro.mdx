# Getting Started

This document serves as a comprehensive, guide for **successfully creating and establishing your 3D interactive space and Metaverse**, allowing businesses, creators and professionals to fully leverage Mext platform capabilities. The individual overseeing the creation of the 3D interactive space and Metaverse is referred to as the organizer and is provided with a streamlined back office for managing and customizing their digital space, including interactivity and analytics.

**The 3D space can be initially generated using a template or starting from a blank digital canvas (city model)**, \*\*providing the flexibility to create your interactive space from scratch according to your own designs, imagination, and specific use cases and preferences. \*\*This customization is easily managed through the administration interface, also
known as the “Admin Backoffice”.

Furthermore, the owner of the 3D space and Metaverse has the flexibility to efficiently create spaces for partners, such as exhibitors, within their own environment. They can provide these partners with dedicated administrative interfaces, such as an exhibitor interface, enabling them to manage their allocated spaces within the Metaverse seamlessly.

**The 3D space and Metaverse come equipped with infrastructure and essential database capabilities for hosting, managing, and onboarding individuals, organizations, and content. Furthermore, it integrates the necessary AI/ML algorithms to facilitate AI-powered virtual assistance, matchmaking, and Gen-AI applications when available. Additionally, it seamlessly interfaces with the Polygon blockchain, facilitating web3 integration. This integration enables a range of use cases, such as issuing certificates using smart contracts and gamification with NFTs, with no need for additional development efforts.**

Mext operates as a web-based platform, removing the necessity for software downloads or installations. It boasts a user-friendly interface, catering to individuals with varying levels of computer proficiency, and can be accessed via desktop computers or through a dedicated mobile app available for both Apple and Android users. Moreover, it is inherently compatible with MetaQuest VR devices, ensuring seamless integration for users across different platforms.

The 3D interactive spaces created through the Mext platform can be hosted in multiple ways: **they can reside on the Mext infrastructure, be embedded within the customer's website, or be entirely hosted on the customer's infrastructure.** This versatility offers a range of hosting options to accommodate diverse preferences.
