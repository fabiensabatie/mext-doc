# Getting Started

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for creating and constructing a metaverse using **MEXT**, enabling you to fully leverage its features and maximize business growth opportunities.

We offer a comprehensive set of tools that allows you to **create and share your own metaverse**, as well as obtaining valuable insights about the world you created. It's **easy-to-use**, and **requires no download**. Everything happens in your browser.

In this documentation, the individual responsible for overseeing the metaverse is referred to as the organizer, who is equipped with a dedicated back office. This back office facilitates efficient management and customization of the organizer's 3D digital environment, along with its associated interactivity and analytics.

By default, **the metaverse is dynamically generated with a preset configuration**, which **you can personalize** through an administration interface, commonly known as the back office. This interface empowers you to tailor the 3D elements and interactivity according to their preferences.

Furthermore, metaverse owners have the autonomy to **generate specialized admin interfaces**, such as an exhibitor interface, on-demand and effortlessly. **These interfaces enable partners to manage specific spaces within the metaverse**, enhancing collaboration and flexibility.

Once generated, the metaverse can be hosted either on Mext Metaverse infrastructure or on the customer's own infrastructure, providing flexibility and options to suit individual requirements.
