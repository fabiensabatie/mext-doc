# Getting Started

This document serves as a comprehensive, guide for **successfully creating and establishing your 3D interactive space and Metaverse**, allowing businesses, creators and professionals to fully leverage Mext platform capabilities. The individual overseeing the creation of the 3D interactive space and Metaverse is referred to as the organizer and is provided with a streamlined back office for managing and customizing their digital space, including interactivity and analytics.

The 3D space can be initially generated using a template or starting from a blank digital canvas (city model), \*\*providing the flexibility to create your interactive space from scratch according to your own designs, imagination, and specific use cases and preferences. \*\*This customization is easily managed through the administration interface, also
known as the “Admin Backoffice”.

Furthermore, the owner of the 3D space and Metaverse has the flexibility to efficiently create spaces for partners, such as exhibitors, within their own environment. They can provide these partners with dedicated administrative interfaces, such as an exhibitor interface, enabling them to manage their allocated spaces within the Metaverse seamlessly.

**The 3D space and Metaverse come equipped with infrastructure and essential database capabilities for hosting, managing, and onboarding individuals, organizations, and content. Furthermore, it integrates the necessary AI/ML algorithms to facilitate AI-powered virtual assistance, matchmaking, and Gen-AI applications when available.
